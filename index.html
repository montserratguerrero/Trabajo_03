        <h2>ðŸŽµ Be Still</h2>
        <p>
          Be still<br>
          And go on to bed<br>
          Nobody knows what lies ahead<br>
          And life is short<br>
          To say the least<br>
          We're in the belly of the beast<br>
          Be still<br>
          Wild and young<br>
          Long may your innocence reign<br>
          Like shells on the shore<br>
          And may your limits be unknown<br>
          And may your efforts be your own<br>
          If you ever feel you can't take it anymore<br>  
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't break character<br>
          You've got a lot of heart<br>
          Is this real or just a dream?<br>
          Rise up like the sun<br>
          Labor 'til the work is done<br>
          Be still<br>
          One day you'll leave<br>
          Fearlessness on your sleeve<br>
          When you've come back, tell me what did you see<br>
          What did you see?<br>
          Was there something out there for me?<br>
